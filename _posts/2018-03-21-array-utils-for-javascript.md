# Array Utils for Typescript/Javascript

## What's for?

I work daily with Java and TypeScript/Javascript, something that I miss in TS/JS from the Java language are powerful Collection classes and ArrayUtils libraries.

Working with REST services I frequently repeat the same operations to maintain the data in the frontend tables in synch with the backend.
Those operations involve updating arrays that represent the backend data. The goal of this library is to ease these manipulations.

The library try to help in situation like :
- Remove a particular element in an array
- Search and replace a particular object in an array using the content of his field
- Delete all the instances of an object
- Work with arrays of data originated from databases
 
## Array Utils

The library is still a work in progress but already working.

You can find the library here: 

npm:[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@molteni/array-utils]
