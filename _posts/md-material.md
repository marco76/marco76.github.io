# Angular Material

For this website we use [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) as frontend library.

Personally I found the Material Design implementations more complicated to use compared to Bootstrap.
For small web applications I suggest to use Bootstrap.

The real power of Material Design is exposed when you want to customize your components or you want a consistent design.

## Material Design guidelines and implementations

Material Design is a document that describe how a GUI should appear or behave.
You can implement yourself these guidelines or use a library framework try to implement them.

A non-exhaustive list of libraries built for Angular is the following:
- [material.angular.io](https://material.angular.io) developed by Google. We use this library for this website.
- [covalent](https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/). Great set of components developed by Teradata.
- [clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/). Library developed by VmWare (the owners of Pivotal).

In my opinion the main issue with Angular Material is the important delay they accumulated in the development and the lack of documentation.

Only few developers are working on the implementation of Material (and even fewer on Bootstrap) for Angular (you can check on GitHub).
This means that if you use these libraries in production you will be alone to understand/fix/extend.
