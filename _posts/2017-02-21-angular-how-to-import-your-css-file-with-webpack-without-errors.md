According to the Angular [documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/component-styles.html) load an external style file in a component is as easy as :
```typescript
template:
    `
        <h2>{{hero.name}}</h2>
        <hero-team [hero]=hero></hero-team>
        <ng-content></ng-content>
    `,
styleUrls: ['app/hero-details.component.css']
```
    
    

This configuration is challenging when you have building process that include Webpack. In our reference [example application](http://angular.cafe) the call of the css file using `styleUrl`
```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'cv-experience',
    templateUrl:'cv-experience.html',
    styleUrls:['cv.css']
})
```
 
resulted in this error:

`{'Uncaught Error: Expected 'styles' to be an array of strings. at assertArrayOfStrings (eval at <anonymous> '}`
    

To solve the issue we had to migrate from Webpack 1.x to the new version 2 and <a href="https://github.com/marco76/SpringAngular2TypeScript" target="_blank">call the css file with the following code</a>:
```typescript
    @Component({
        selector: 'cv-experience',
        templateUrl:'cv-experience.html',
        styles:[require('./cv.css').toString()]
    })
```    

This is the loader of Webpack
```typescript
    { test: /\.css$/, loader: "style-loader!css-loader" },
    { test: /\.scss$/,loaders: ['style', 'css', 'postcss', 'sass'] }
```
