_Updated December 08, 2013_

In few articles I&#8217;ll describe how to integrate Spring MVC with Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, Spring Security, Dandelion, JPA, etc.
  
I started to develop a small framework with the goal to allow developers to start a new web application quickly.

The target features of the framework are:

  * user security
  * user authentication, password reset, …
  * jquery datatables</>
  * document management (upload, …)
  * bootstrap
  * thymeleaf templating
  * extention

<del datetime="2013-12-02T19:50:48+00:00">The base framework is here: <a href="https://github.com/marco76/geniweb">https://github.com/marco76/geniweb</a></del> (old version based on xml)
  
The base framework is here: <a title="https://github.com/marco76/basicMVC" href="https://github.com/marco76/basicMVC" target="_blank">https://github.com/marco76/basicMVC</a> (version based on annotations)

I use this framework for my personal projects and it&#8217;s in alpha phase. It&#8217;s not intended for production use (yet), but you can use it to see how these technologies integrates together.

On the top of the framework (a jar + some config files) you have the possibility to build your own application.

Here is the example of the result without almost any effort.

<img alt="Framework1" src="https://i2.wp.com/javaee.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/geniwebframework1.png?resize=600%2C146" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />

The web application allows some pages to be accessible to anonymous users and other pages to be accessible only to recorded users.

New users have the possibility of &#8216;signup&#8217; (with or without reCaptcha) &#8230;
  
[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-464" alt="signup" src="https://i1.wp.com/javaee.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signup.png?resize=300%2C145" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i1.wp.com/javaee.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signup.png)

and receive an email (generated by velocity) to verify the e-mail address
  
[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-462" alt="mail" src="https://i2.wp.com/javaee.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mail.png?resize=300%2C108" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i2.wp.com/javaee.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mail.png)

If the user click on the activation his account is created in the database and automatically logged in.

Some of the features:

  * I added an **asyncExecutor** to avoid to block the application during the sending of mails
  * The template resolver/engine used is the one of **Thymeleaf**
  * **DataTableDialect** allows the use of the library Dandelion (wrapper of JQuery datatables)
  * **SpringSecurityDialect** allows the integration of SpringSecurity with Thymeleaf
  * **CommonsMultipartResolver**: used to upload files
  * **Embedded database** to use the solution out-of-the-box in dev mode
  * **Logback** logging
  * **Tomcat** and **Jetty** (Embedded) support
