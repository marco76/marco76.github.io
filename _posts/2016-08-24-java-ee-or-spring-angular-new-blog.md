Dear All ðŸ™‚

  * I see that most of the views of my blog in the last months (btw thanks for the visit!) are connected to the articles about Angular 2 and Spring.
  * I see that on the market Java developers are required to know more and more Angular for the new project, that JSF and Struts are replaced by Angular.
  * I know that is not easy to match together the 2 different approaches and technologies.

I was thinking about the opportunity to create <span style="color: #ff0000;">a new website or blog with the goal to collect the best practices to develop with Java and Angular together from a Java developer perspective</span>. What do you think?

I would limit it to Angular 2 and not AngularJS (1.x). The time is limited.

Any comment or idea is welcome!
