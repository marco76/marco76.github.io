##### Complete Java EE and Angular example

_New demo available here_: <http://javademo.io> &#8211; <https://github.com/marco76/java-demo> &#8211; <http://javaee.ch/2017/04/06/java-angular-demo/>

##### Problem we need a new web application that uses Java EE as backend and Angular as frontend. It should be easy to configure.

##### Solution you can find the code of the application here:

<https://github.com/marco76/javaee-angular-starter> The scope of the application is limited (1 angular route, 1 http service, only a JSON ressource), this allow you to start with a clean application. I will build another app to shows some other features.

#### Features

  * frontend built and compatible with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io)
  * configured to use the development and production mode of WebPack
  * ready to use out of the box
  * build a WAR file compatible with Java EE servers (JBoss, Payara/Glassfish etc.)
  * it comes with all the nice features of Angular CLI: tests, good practices etc.
  * automatic deploy during the development

### How to install

##### Prerequisites -you need maven, npm, git and an application server Java EE

##### Production mode

  1. clone the git project
  2. from the root of the project launch `mvn package` this generates a package named _ROOT.war_ in the _PROJECT/server/target_ directory
  3. you can deploy this package in your favourite application server. The Angular application should answer at the requests to _http://localhost:8080_

##### Development mode

  1. clone the git project
  2. You can start the server using your favourite IDE. The project uses a standard Maven directory structure. You need to configure the server to deploy the _server.war_ artifact.
  3. from the _PROJECT/client/src_ directory install the npm packages : `npm install`
  4. launch the client with `ng serve`. The client uses the port 4200 (default for Angular CLI) and you can navigate to _http://localhost:4200_

### The result

It show the result of a call to a Java REST service &#8230; but hey, you have a ready to go configuration based on Java EE and Angular that follows the Angular best practices.

#### How it works As for the previous

[Angular/Spring project](http://javaee.ch/2016/02/23/spring-boot-angularjs-2-typescript-hello-world-tutorial/) we have a main maven project with 2 modules :

    <modules>
        <module>client</module>
        <module>server</module>
    </modules>
    

Client: contains the Angular project generated using Angular CLI (= top quality) Server: contains the Java EE project (very minimalistic, 1 REST service and 1 filter to avoid the CORS restrictions during the development). When we build the final package the angular project is build and the result saved in a directory that will be integrated in the Java EE build. During the development the two separate projects are deployed. For the production only 1 deployable war is generated. Here the details of the maven build phase:
