I found two interesting presentations of Spring MVC 3 (part of Spring Framework, still in RC phase)
  
[Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/kensipe/spring-mvc-code-mash09-presentation)
   
and a second presentation in [pdf](www.devnexus.com/presentations/WhatsNewInSpring3.pdf)
  

  
The big improvement is the full support of REST and logical URI parameters. Spring EL is now available and there is no more dependency with other EL libraries (JBoss and OSGI).
